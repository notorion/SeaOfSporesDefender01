Hello. The 'fungus' has the function of protecting specific places, trying to prevent players from collecting resources in various locations simultaneously.
Fungus damage in the official version can exceed 300k, varying according to the player's level and equipment. In this version, the damage is significantly reduced, configured to 70k. This can be adjusted in the power skill.

The 'Fungus' do not die, are not targetable, do not suffer royal damage. They are there only to disturb players that try more than two spots.



This script is based on the official 'EU' model.

In the 'Diff' update, there is a route correction in the sea of ​​spores; An earlier configuration impressed that the player was swimming while moving, which was quite confusing. It is now corrected to allow normal walk.
